# Separation-Of-Background-Music-From-Singer-s-Vocals-And-Singer-s-Identi-cation
Facing the diversity and growth of the musical field nowadays, the search for precise songs becomes more and more complex. The identity of the singer facilitates this search. Hence, in this project, we focus on the problem of identifying the singer according to the acoustic characteristics of the singer's voice. This process consists of three crucial parts. First, the vocal signal is separated from the background music by using the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA). Second, features from the obtained vocal signal are extracted. Here, the goal is to study the performance of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) in comparison to the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) which is the most used technique in audio signals. Finally, we proceed with the identification of the singer where two methods have experimented: the Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We conclude that, for a dataset of 4 singers and 200 songs, the best identification system consists of DWT (db4) for feature extraction and SVM-Linear for identication. This system gives an accuracy of 76.35%.
